          <p class="center">
            An accordion is a musical instrument that has keys similar to a
            piano, but is small enough for a person to hold. It makes sounds
            using air pushed and pulled through reeds using a bellows. The
            accordion can also have buttons instead of keys. The 6-plus-6-system
            with three rows has the same fingering in all twelve scales. The
            accordion was first patented in 1829 in Austria by Cyrill Demain.

          <p class="center">
            The bagpipes are a musical instrument. They are sometimes just
            called "pipes". They have a bag that holds air. The player keeps the
            bag full of air by blowing into it with a tube or pumping it with a
            bellows. To make music, the bag is pressed and the air comes out
            through a kind of flute or "chanter". There are usually one or more
            other tubes coming from the bag that make sounds whenever the bag is
            squeezed, called "drones".

            The bassoon is the lowest of the four main instrument of the
            woodwind family. Like the oboe, it has a double reed. The reed is
            attached to a curved metal mouthpiece called a "crook" or "bocal"
            which is joined to the main part of the instrument. This consists of
            two parts called ‘bass joint’ and ‘wing joint’ (or ‘tenor joint’).
            These two are joined at the bottom by a U-shaped piece called the
            ‘boot’. At the top of the instrument is the ‘bell joint’. The
            instrument is quite heavy.

            The banjo is a string instrument, that was first played by African
            slaves in the United States a few hundred years ago. The idea came
            from other African instruments.[1] The name banjo may have come from
            a Kimbundu word: mbanza, but it could have also come from a
            Senegambian word for the bamboo stick used for the banjo's neck.

            The cello is an instrument used to play music. Its name comes from
            the Italian language, so it is pronounced “chello”. The full word is
            violoncello, but when speaking, people normally call it the “cello”.
            A person who plays the cello is called a “cellist”. The cello is a
            very popular instrument. It belongs to the string family. It has
            many uses: as a solo instrument, in chamber music and also in
            orchestras. It is also occasionally used by pop musicians.

            The cor anglais, or English horn, is a double reed instrument in the
            woodwind family. It is very similar to an oboe, but as it is longer
            than an oboe it plays lower notes. The lowest note of an oboe is B
            flat (just below Middle C). The lowest note of a cor anglais is an E
            natural, a diminished fifth (five notes of a scale, minus a
            semitone) lower than the oboe's lowest note. The cor anglais is a
            transposing instrument pitched in F.

            cylindrical or conical in shape. It is best described as being a

          <p class="center">
            The double bass is a big stringed instrument that terms, perhaps
            more correct, include contrabass and upright bass. It is used in
            orchestras, jazz bands, rockabilly bands, bluegrass music, and some
            country music bands. It plays low-pitched musical notes in musical
            ensembles and bands. In jazz bands, these low-pitched musical notes
            are called the "bass line." The double bass looks like smaller
            instruments like the violin, viola, and cello.

            players), or a small pick made of thin plastic. Different finger

            the frame, which is usually a triangle made of wood. Each string is
            tight, and the frame must be strong so that the many tight strings

            Harpsichords are keyboard instruments that make sound by having the
            strings plucked with a plectrum. They are thought to have originated
            when a keyboard was attached to a psaltery. This makes them
            different from a clavichord where the strings are hit.In a piano it
            is possible to play louder or quieter by playing the keys with more
            or less force. On a harpsichord the volume (playing louder or
            softer) cannot be controlled by the way it is played.

            The tabla invention is found in India. It is also used for
            classical, popular and devotional music of Pakistan. The instrument
            is two hand drums of different size and shape, similar to bongos.
            They make different sounds. The drums are treble and bass drum.
            Tabla is played hitting the fingers on the drum head and sliding the
            palm to create a modulating sound. A lot of sounds can be created
            from the tabla by changing how you use your hands.

            The tambourine is a common percussion instrument. The tambourine
            looks like a small hand-held drum. But in addition to the skin
            (drumhead) there are also small pairs of jingles - like tiny cymbals
            - in slots around the frame. However, tambourines come in many
            types. Some are made without a skin, particularly for use in
            schools. The tambourine came to Europe through the Arabs who brought
            it to Italy and Spain.

            The trombone is a brass horn musical instrument. It is similar to a
            large trumpet, except the player pushes and pulls on its slide to
            change the length of the tube. Together with vibrations from the
            player's lips, the trombone can play a wide range of notes. It
            sounds deeper than a trumpet and is usually said to be one of the
            bass clef instruments. Music is normally written in the bass clef,
            but some high parts can be written in tenor clef. Some players have
            the music transposed into the treble clef. The trombone is the
            loudest instrument in the symphony orchestra.

            The tuba is the biggest of all the brass musical instruments. They
            are the newest part of the symphony orchestra, first showing up in
            the mid-19th century. Most orchestras have a tuba now. Because they
            are so big, some tubas have a compensating system. This means a
            fourth, fifth or sixth valve is used to make the instrument sound
            more in tune . It takes a lot of breath to play the tuba. It is one
            of the loudest instruments in the orchestra but can also play very
            quietly.

            The violin is a string instrument which has four strings and is
            played with a bow.[1] The strings are usually tuned to the notes G,
            D, A, and E.[2] It is held between the left collar bone (near the
            shoulder) and the chin. Different notes are made by fingering
            (pressing on the strings) with the left hand while bowing with the
            right. Unlike guitar, it has no frets or other markers on the
            fingerboard.

            A xylophone is a musical instrument that is part of the percussion

            percussion" or tuned percussion because it can play different
            pitches and is a different way of expressing the sound that it
            creats. (notes). Xylophones have bars which are made of wood. People
            play the xylophone by hitting the bars with a mallet (a kind of drum
            stick). Each piece of wood is a different length, so they play
            different notes when they are hit.

            A zither is a stringed musical instrument. The word 'Zither' is a
            German rendering of the Greek word cithara, from which the modern
            word "guitar" also derives. Historically, it has been applied to any
            instrument of the cittern family, or an instrument consisting of
            many strings stretched across a thin, flat body – similar to a
            psaltery. This article describes the second variety.
